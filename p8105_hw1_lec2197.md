Before starting anything, I'm going to load packages `here` and `tidyverse`. I'm loading `here` in case I need to work with any data: it helps find source files without being super picky about where they are. Jenny Bryan recommended it in one of the readings. I'm loading `tidyverse` because I suspect I may need to use it to create plots.

``` r
library(here)
```

    ## here() starts at /Users/laura/datascience1/p8105_hw1_lec2197

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Problem 1
---------

My goal is to create a data frame comprised of some specified vectors.

First, I created the following vectors:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   A (length-10) character vector
-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
rand_sample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
log_vector <- rand_sample > 2
char_vector <- character(length = 10)
fact_vector <- factor(log_vector)
```

Now I'm going to bind them in a dataframe.

``` r
all_data <- tibble(rand_sample, log_vector, char_vector, fact_vector)
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn’t? Why?

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens? In a second code chunk, convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?
