Before starting anything, I'm going to load the package `tidyverse`, because I suspect I may need to use it to create plots and dataframes.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Problem 1
---------

My goal is to create a data frame comprised of some specified vectors.

First, I created the following vectors:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform \[0, 5\] distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   A (length-10) character vector
-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1)
rand_sample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
log_vector <- rand_sample > 2
char_vector <- character(length = 10)
fact_vector <- factor(c("l","a","u","r","a","c","o","s","g","r"))
```

I had to create the vectors first before binding them in a dataframe, because the logical vector's creation depends on the existence of the random sample vector. Now, I'm going to bind them in a dataframe.

``` r
one_data <- tibble(rand_sample, log_vector, char_vector, fact_vector)
```

Taking the mean will only work for some vectors. This is because the mean function requires numeric inputs or logical inputs. (For logical inputs, the function interprets as binary: i.e., `FALSE` is coded as `0` and `TRUE` is coded as `1`.)

``` r
mean(rand_sample)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(log_vector)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(char_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(fact_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fact_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Both factor and logical vectors convert to numeric vectors without R having to coerce NAs. Factor vectors convert to numeric vectors in terms of what R computes as levels, which are assigned a series of integers. Elements with the same level will code as the same number, but it's not an ordered conversion in terms of the first element's level being assigned `1`, and so on. Rather, it depends on the underlying data. For my example, where I converted a factor vector of the letters in my name, the factor levels are ordered in alphabetical order upon assigning the integer levels. In other words, "a" gets factor level `1`, and so on.

Logical vectors convert in the same way as mentioned above in reference to taking the mean, i.e., the conversion functions interprets as binary where `FALSE` is coded as `0` and `TRUE` is coded as `1`.

``` r
fact_to_num <- as.numeric(fact_vector)
char_to_num <- as.numeric(char_vector)
log_to_num <- as.numeric(log_vector)
```

Character vectors, on the other hand, do not convert to logical vectors without coercion of NAs. However, we can test this one more time with a different character vector than my default creation of empty characters using the `character(length = 10)` function, by first converting my factor vector to character and then to numeric. We can also test if converting the factor vector first to character, and then to numeric, will be successful.

``` r
char_to_num_2 <- as.numeric(as.factor(char_vector))
fact_to_num_2 <- as.numeric(as.character(fact_vector))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

As expected, the second character vector conversion to numeric by way of a factor conversion succeeded, while a factor vector conversion to numeric by way of a character conversion failed. The different elements in the vectors did not make a difference.

Problem 2
---------

I created `two_data`, a data frame comprised of:

-   x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
-   y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether the x + y &gt; 0
-   A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
-   A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

``` r
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- rnorm(1000)
ifsum <- (x + y) > 0
num_ifsum <- as.numeric(ifsum)
fact_ifsum <- as.factor(num_ifsum)
two_data <- tibble(x, y, ifsum, num_ifsum, fact_ifsum)
```

The dimensions, or size, of `two_data` is 1000, 5, meaning that the dataframe is comprised of 5 vectors of length 1000. The mean of x is -0.0106382, the median of x is -0.031318, and the proportion of cases for which the logical vector is `TRUE` is 0.49.

Now we can visualize the data using scatterplots. Three identical-looking plots can be made of the x vs. y data with color coding on the statement `x + y > 0` since we created a logical vector evaluating that expression, and, coerced from that logical vector, a numeric vector and a factor vector. However, ggplot will have different legend defaults when asked to map color on different types of variables. For logical vectors, the legend options are binary, `TRUE` and `FALSE`; factor vectors, similarly, have a binary legand with `0` and `1` as options. Numeric vectors, however, are assumed to be continuous, and so have a continuous gradient scale, even though our data only have `0` and `1` as options.

``` r
plot_logical <- ggplot(two_data, aes(x, y, color = ifsum)) + geom_point(size = 0.5)
plot_numeric <- ggplot(two_data, aes(x, y, color = num_ifsum)) + geom_point(size = 0.5)
plot_factor <- ggplot(two_data, aes(x, y, color = fact_ifsum)) + geom_point(size = 0.5)
plot_logical
```
