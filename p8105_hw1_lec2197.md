Before starting anything, I'm going to load packages `here` and `tidyverse`. I'm loading `here` in case I need to work with any data: it helps find source files without being super picky about where they are. Jenny Bryan recommended it in one of the readings. I'm loading `tidyverse` because I suspect I may need to use it to create plots.

``` r
library(here)
```

Problem 1
---------

My goal is to create a data frame comprised of some specified vectors.

First, I created the following vectors:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   A (length-10) character vector
-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1)
rand_sample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
log_vector <- rand_sample > 2
char_vector <- character(length = 10)
fact_vector <- factor(log_vector)
```

I had to create the vectors first before binding them in a dataframe, because some of the vectors' creation depends on the existence of another vector. Now, I'm going to bind them in a dataframe.

``` r
all_data <- tibble(rand_sample, log_vector, char_vector, fact_vector)
```

Taking the mean will only work for some vectors. This is because the mean function requires numeric inputs or logical inputs. (For logical inputs, the function interprets as binary: i.e., `FALSE` is coded as `0` and `TRUE` is coded as `1`.)

``` r
mean(rand_sample)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(log_vector)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(char_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(fact_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fact_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens? In a second code chunk, convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?

``` r
fact_to_num <- as.numeric(fact_vector)
char_to_num <- as.numeric(char_vector)
log_to_num <- as.numeric(log_vector)
```

``` r
char_to_num_2 <- as.numeric(as.factor(char_vector))
fact_to_num_2 <- as.numeric(as.character(fact_vector))
```
