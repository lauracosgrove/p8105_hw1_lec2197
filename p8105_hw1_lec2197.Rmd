Before starting anything, I'm going to load packages `here` and `tidyverse`. I'm loading `here` in case I need to work with any data: it helps find source files without being super picky about where they are. Jenny Bryan recommended it in one of the readings. I'm loading `tidyverse` because I suspect I may need to use it to create plots.

```{r adding libraries}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

My goal is to create a data frame comprised of some specified vectors.

First, I created the following vectors:

* A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
* A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
* A (length-10) character vector
* A (length-10) factor vector

```{r create vectors}
rand_sample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
log_vector <- rand_sample > 2
char_vector <- character(length = 10)
fact_vector <- factor(log_vector)
```

Now I'm going to bind them in a dataframe.

```{r bind in tibble}
all_data <- tibble(rand_sample, log_vector, char_vector, fact_vector)
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t? Why?

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the  as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens? In a second code chunk, convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?



```{r}
```
